We call politeness to the system of rules that regulates the personal
interactions in each culture. This system involves both, language use
and gestures, physical proximity, looks, and all the behaviour we
activate every time we talk to each other.

Politeness rules can vary a lot from one culture to another. Therefore; 
being unaware of them can cause real problems to a second language
speaker.

In the "Río de la Plata” spanish, the alternance between _vos_ and
_usted_ in the second person, is one of the most important marks of the
level of formality the speaker gives to a bond or interaction. So, the
_usted_ form is used to talk with older people, or in an unequal 
hierarchy relationship to show respect or a high level of social 
distance.

However, the use and alternance between both forms vary from one region
to another (there are regions of América where _usted_ is used only in
intimate contexts) and also vary over the years: In Argentina, fifty
years ago it was usual for childs to call their parents using the
_usted_ pronoun, it was a respectful form; but this use would result
strange for most of young people nowadays.

To awareness and practice of politeness rules, is one of the main
interests during the acquisition of a second language, and we work about
this constantly during **cheDALE** class hours. Next we’ll share a
production from a A2 level student, Jun Il. He is korean and in his
texts he talks about the politeness rules in his original culture:

> _"En mi país tratamos de cortesía normalmente según la edad. Y también
ocasiones oficiales. Por eso cuando la gente [se] encuentra primero
ellos preguntan la edad. La fórmula para saludar es inclinar su cabeza
o dar manos, estrechar. Besos en mejilla es raro. Y también se inclina
su rodilla y cabeza o frente a lo[s] más mayores, cuando feriados
grandes y eventos importantes. Para agradecer, hoy en día es común dar
dinero, pero regalo hecho a mano expresa más agradecimiento."_
