We call politeness to the system of rules that regulates the personal interactions in each culture. This system involves both, language use and gestures, physical proximity, looks, and all the behaviour we activate every time we talk to each other.

Politeness rules can vary a lot from one culture to another. Therefore; being unaware of them can cause real problems to a second language speaker.

In the “Rio de la Plata” spanish, the alternance between “vos” and “usted” in the second person, is one of the most important marks of the level of formality the speaker gives to a bond or  interaction. So, the “usted” form is used to talk with older people, or in an unequal hierarchy relationship to show respect or a high level of social distance.

However, the use and alternance between both forms vary from one region to another (there are regions of América where “usted” is used only in  intimate contexts) and also vary over the years: In Argentina, fifty years ago it was usual for childs to call their parents using the  “usted” pronoun, it was a respectful form; but this use would result strange for most of young people nowadays.

To awareness and practice of politeness rules, is one of the main interests during the acquisition of a second language, and we work about this constantly during cheDALE class hours. Next we’ll share a production from a A2 level student, Jun Il. He is korean and in his texts he talks about the politeness rules in his original culture:

<i>"En mi país tratamos de cortesía normalmente según la edad. Y también ocasiones oficiales. Por eso cuando la gente [se] encuentra primero ellos preguntan la edad. La fórmula para saludar es inclinar su cabeza o dar manos, estrechar. Besos en mejilla es raro. Y también se inclina su rodilla y cabeza o frente a lo[s] más mayores, cuando feriados grandes y eventos importantes. Para agradecer, hoy en día es común dar dinero, pero regalo hecho a mano expresa más agradecimiento."</i>
